# YASM: Yet Another Social Media

Idk. I'm not a big fan of Facebook, or twitter as a social media. Reddit is
pretty good but all social media use an "algorithm" to chose which posts you see,
which comments, they make suggestions on who to follow or groups to join.

Meh. None of that. This is to be a KISS social media. You follow someone. You
see their posts in chronological order based on the last post you saw. Nothing
is private. All posts can be seen by everyone. All comments can be seen by
everyone.

I'm thinking 3 strikes you're out. If 3 people report a post it's removed.

I'm also thinking that all posts have a 2 year lifespan after that they're
deleted.
